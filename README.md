# ractive-bootstrap-experiments

Experimenting with building [Ractive.js](http://www.ractivejs.org/) components based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)  markup and styles.

Current repository is a __work in progress__, with one page POC demonstrating basic approach.

End goal is to build up a library of reusable components, similar to [React Bootstrap](http://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

The solution should be optimised before using on production.

### Getting started

1. ```npm install```
2. ```grunt copy```
3. ```node server```

### Live reload
You have to run ```grunt watch``` task in a separate window in order to use live reload.
